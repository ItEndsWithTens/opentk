This is a personal fork of [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk) for use in my own projects, in particular [Arbatel](https://github.com/ItEndsWithTens/Arbatel), containing any bug fixes and tweaks I'm interested in.

For my work I've branched off of commit c8d58738 from the 3.0 branch, which if I'm not mistaken contains the most up-to-date code for OpenTK 3. If I am mistaken, well, that'll be par for the course.

In any event, if my changes interest you, by all means have at them! Just keep in mind that I'm not an OpenTK expert, so please see the main OpenTK repository for details about the original library if you need detailed help.
